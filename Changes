0.007     2022-12-06 11:37:59+08:00 Asia/Singapore
    [Bugs fixed]
    - decimal (floating point) value conversion upgraded from `float` to `double`,
    and switched to Perl number-parsing routine for better accuracy (technically
    allows slightly more than the official protocol, but better than rolling our own)

    [Bugs fixed]

    [Dependencies]
