NAME

    Net::Async::Redis::XS - like Net::Async::Redis but faster

SYNOPSIS

     use feature qw(say);
     use Future::AsyncAwait;
     use IO::Async::Loop;
     use Net::Async::Redis::XS;
     my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new;
     $loop->add(my $redis = Net::Async::Redis::XS);
     await $redis->connect;
     await $redis->set('some-key', 'some-value');
     say await $redis->get('some-key');

DESCRIPTION

    This is a wrapper around Net::Async::Redis with faster protocol
    parsing.

    It implements the Net::Async::Redis::Protocol protocol code in XS for
    better performance, and will eventually be extended to optimise some
    other slow paths as well in future.

    API and behaviour should be identical to Net::Async::Redis, see there
    for instructions.
